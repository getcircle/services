this is similar to the pain points i had with finding info in EB
engineering, seems like it has gotten worse too.

Hey! That's exciting. Ok - as an insider to EB we have a hell of a time
with documentation of anything. There are plenty of document, but they are
not easily findable.

   - We use https://readthedocs.org/ for docs. But the search doesn't seem
   to handle anything besides string matching. So you have to have a perfect
   phrase match or oh well.
   - Also we don't have just one readthedocs site, but 3(ish) and search
   doesn't cross over between them. You have to know where the information is
   in order to find the information.
   - Additionally we have readme's in all our repos that usually aren't
   searchable (I think some of these are hooked up to readthedocs, but mostly
   not).
   - We also have scads of older docs in Atlassian Confluence.
   - Plenty of stuff in Google Docs.
   - Plenty of stuff in Slack conversations and Slack "Posts"

If I was building you product (and I'm not... but it's fun to conjecture
since I don't have anything on the line) one thing I would try is just to
build an index and search UI that unites all these things. Then you don't
have to worry about storing or pretty formatting anything from these
sources. And you don't have to worry about authoring tools. And it's easier
on-boarding for your users.

The harder part of the problem is something that is more all-encompassing.
My very own notes are almost useless to me a few months from now. How do
you figure out how to highlight well-written and useful information, throw
away un-useful information, and (the really hard part) glean help from the
information that's moderately useful.

Pretty fun stuff! Tell me when I should invest!
