In my new role as Inside Sales Manager my responsibility will be to lay the groundwork for the Lookout inside sales team of tomorrow which will be based in the upstart downtown Boston office. I feel that in this new role I have the unique opportunity to get back to the business of being a seller while simultaneously working with the channel, sales, marketing and operations teams to lay a solid framework for success.

I am joining the team with nearly four years experience at Juniper Networks where I built and managed successful inside sales teams in two theatres (EMEA and America's).  In my most recent role as Inside Sales Manager- East Coast US, my responsibility was to recruit, train and and make effective a team of inside sales reps, the majority of which were recent college grads. Teaching the ropes to people new to IT sales and grooming them to be creative, ethical and successful leaders is my passion and I think that the Boston office is a fantastic location to create a business unit that can add significant value and operate in lock step as part of Lookout's channel-centric enterprise strategy. 

On a more personal level, I am originally from Long Island, New York and am happily married for 3.5 years to my wife Laura. I am an avid traveler and enjoy outdoor activities such as skiing, cycling, tennis/squash and hiking... all well disposed to the winter wonderland we call Boston :) 

For inside sales at Lookout to be successful it will be a team effort and I look forward to meeting as much of the team as possible in the coming weeks.

I went to the University of Lowell, now called UMass (Lowell) and graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree.   By the first summer after graduating I got the programming bug while developing games in BASIC on the Atari computer and quickly realized I should have chosen computer science as my major ;)

I landed my first high tech job at Wang Laboratories, which was the dominant mini-computer manufacturer at the time.  I taught myself how to program while testing IBM PC emulation products -  actually started my programming career by developing devices drivers using 8088/8086 assembly language, and followed the Intel microprocessor trajectory through the advancements in the Microsoft/Intel architecture.

After Wang Laboratories I joined a startup called Proteon Software, which was at the forefront of networking long before the Cisco's and Juniper's existed.  I moved through networking companies as the networking industry changed and matured - Wellfleet (Routers), BayNetworks (Routers), 3Com (L2/L3 switches), Redstone/Juniper Networks (Edge switcher routers), pursued an MBA degree and started my career in engineering management.

Most recently I was at Nuance Communications, which develops speech recognition systems.  I was responsible for the Vlingo organization in Cambridge Ma, which was acquired by Nuance in 2011.  While at Nuance, I worked closely with Samsung and developed SVoice, which is the Android version of Siri, and executed 5 major mobile launches starting with the Galaxy Series 4 and most recently finishing with the Note4 and Galaxy Gear 3 Smart Watch.

On the personal side, in September I celebrated my 24th wedding anniversary and I have 3 teenage children - 2 boys and a girl ages 18, 17 and almost 16, going on 21 ;)

When I'm not working, I'm either spending time with my family or pursuing one of my other 3 interests: golf, cooking/entertaining or the piano.
